When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to publish my work, either free of charge to the public or for a fee. I might also edit my work on another device, such as
a laptop or phone, then commit it and later pull all the changes back to my local depositary.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Firstly, other users might add commits to your master remote repository without you knowing. If Git automatically stays up-to-date, this will set
the programmer up for disaster. Rather, it is much safer for the 
programmer to decide when is a good time to pull changes from the remote
repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks allow me to copy repositories from other GitHubbers onto my GitHub account. I can then clone the repositories to my local one so 
i can commit changes to it. Clones can be used locally. Branches are used locally to diverge on a master path on experimental or mode 
changes to the original codes.
